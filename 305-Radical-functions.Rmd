## The Law of Lever

```{block2, type="rmdthink"}

 > “Give me a fulcrum and a place to stand, I will move the world.” by [Archimedes of Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#Mathematics)

 In volume I of his book "On the Equilibrium of Planes", Archimedes proved that magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights. See the video [Law of the Lever](https://youtu.be/yhrR4384SGE?t=8) on youtube for an animated explanation.

Suppose there is a infinite long lever with a load 100 newton that is placed 1 meters away the fulcrum, the pivoting point.

- Can you find the force needed to balance the load in terms of the distance away from the fulcrum?
- How much force will be needed if it is place 5 meters away from the fulcrum?

## The Domain of a Rational Function

A ***rational function*** $f$ is defined by an equation $f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials and the degree of $q(x)$ is at least one. Since the denominator cannot be zero, the domain of $f$ consists all real numbers except the numbers such that $q(x)=0$

```{example}

Find the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x-1}$.

```

```{solution}
\

Solve the equation $x-1=0$, we get $x=1$. Then the domain is $\{x\mid x\neq 1\}$. In interval notation, the domain is
$$
(-\infty, 1)\cup (1,\infty).
$$

## Speed of a Tsunami

```{block2, type="rmdthink"}

A [tsunami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami) is generally referred to is a series of waves on the ocean caused by earthquakes or other events that cause sudden displacements of large volumes of water. In ideal situation, the velocity $v$ of a wave at where the water depth is $d$ meters is approximately
$$
v=\sqrt{9.8d}.
$$
The wave will slow down when closer to the coast but will be higher.

Suppose a tsunami was caused by earthquake somewhere 10000 meters away the coast of California. The depth of the water where the tsunami was generated is 5000 meter.

- What's the initial speed of the tsunami?
- What's the speed of the tsunami at where the water depth is 2000.
- Suppose the speed wouldn't decrease, how long it takes the tsunami reach the coast?

## The Domain of a Radical Function

A ***radical function*** $f$ is defined by an equation $f(x)=\sqrt[n]{r(x)}$, where $r(x)$ is an algebraic expression.  For example $f(x)=\sqrt{x+1}$. When $n$ is odd number, $r(x)$ can be any real number.  When $n$ is even, $r(x)$ has to be nonnegative, that is $r(x)\geq 0$ so that $f(x)$ is a real number.

```{example}

Find the domain of the function $f(x)=\sqrt{x+1}$.

```

```{solution}
\

Since the index is $2$ which is even, the function has real outputs only if the radicand $x+1\geq 0$.
Solve the inequality, we get $x\geq -1$. In interval notation, the domain is
$$
[-1,\infty).
$$
