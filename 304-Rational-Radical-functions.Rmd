# Rational and Radical Functions

## The Domain of a Rational Function

A ***rational function*** $f$ is defined by an equation $f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, where $p(x)$ and $q(x)$ are polynomials and the degree of $q(x)$ is at least one. Since the denominator cannot be zero, the domain of $f$ consists all real numbers except the numbers such that $q(x)=0$

```{example}

Find the domain of the function $f(x)=\frac{1}{x-1}$.

```

```{solution}
\

Solve the equation $x-1=0$, we get $x=1$. Then the domain is $\{x\mid x\neq 1\}$. In interval notation, the domain is
$$
(-\infty, 1)\cup (1,\infty).
$$

```

## The Domain of a Radical Function

A ***radical function*** $f$ is defined by an equation $f(x)=\sqrt[n]{r(x)}$, where $r(x)$ is an algebraic expression.  For example $f(x)=\sqrt{x+1}$. When $n$ is odd number, $r(x)$ can be any real number.  When $n$ is even, $r(x)$ has to be nonnegative, that is $r(x)\geq 0$ so that $f(x)$ is a real number.

```{example}

Find the domain of the function $f(x)=\sqrt{x+1}$.

```

```{solution}
\

Since the index is $2$ which is even, the function has real outputs only if the radicand $x+1\geq 0$.
Solve the inequality, we get $x\geq -1$. In interval notation, the domain is
$$
[-1,\infty).
$$
