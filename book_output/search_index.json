With $12, would you like to order one 12-inches and two 8-inches. Why? A sheet of everyday copy paper is about 0.01 millimeter thick. Repeat folding along a different side 20 times. Now, how thick do you think the folded paper is? 1.2 Properties of Exponents For an integer \\(n\\), and an expression \\(x\\), the mathematical operation of the \\(n\\)-times repeated multiplication of \\(x\\) is call exponentiation, written as \\(x^n\\), that is, \\[ x^n=\\underbrace{x\\cdot x \\cdots x}_{n \\text{factors of} x}. \\] In the notation \\(x^n\\), \\(n\\) is called the exponent, \\(x\\) is called the base, and \\(x^n\\) is called the power, read as “\\(x\\) raised to the \\(n\\)-th power”, “\\(x\\) to the \\(n\\)-th power”, “\\(x\\) to the \\(n\\)-th”, “\\(x\\) to the power of \\(n\\)” or “\\(x\\) to the \\(n\\)”. Property Example The product rule \\[x^m\\cdot x^n=x^{m+n}.\\] \\[2x^2\\cdot (-3x^3)=-6x^5.\\] The quotient rule (for \\(x\\neq 0\\).) \\[\\dfrac{x^m}{x^n}= \\begin{cases} x^{m-n} &amp; \\text{if} m\\ge n.\\\\[1em] \\dfrac{1}{x^{n-m}} &amp; \\text{if} m\\le n. \\end{cases} \\] \\[\\frac{15x^5}{5x^2}=3x^3;\\] \\[\\frac{-3x^2}{6x^3}=-\\frac{1}{2x}.\\] The zero exponent rule (for \\(x\\neq 0\\).) \\[x^0=1.\\] \\[(-2)^0=1;\\] \\[-x^0=-1.\\] The negative exponent rule (for \\(x\\neq 0\\).) \\[x^{-n}=\\dfrac{1}{x^n} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\dfrac{1}{x^{-n}}=x^n.\\] \\[(-2)^{-3}=\\frac{1}{(-2)^3}=-\\frac18;\\] \\[\\frac{x^{-2}}{x^{-3}}=\\frac{x^3}{x^2}=x.\\] The power to a power rule \\[\\left(x^a\\right)^b=x^{ab}.\\] \\[\\left(2^{2}\\right)^3=2^6=64;\\] \\[\\left(x^2\\right)^3=x^6.\\] The product raised to a power rule \\[(xy)^n=x^ny^n.\\] \\[\\left(-2x\\right)^{2}=(-2)^2x^2=4x^2.\\] The quotient raised to a power rule (for \\(y\\neq 0\\).) \\[\\left(\\dfrac{x}{y}\\right)^n=\\dfrac{x^n}{y^n}.\\] \\[ \\left(\\dfrac{x}{-2}\\right)^{3}=\\dfrac{x^3}{(-2)^3}=-\\dfrac{x^3}{8}.\\] Order of Basic Mathematical Operations In mathematics, the order of operations reflects conventions about which procedure should be performed first. There are four levels (from the highest to the lowest): Parenthesis; Exponentiation; Multiplication and Division; Addition and Subtraction. Within the same level, the convention is to perform from the left to the right. Example 1.1 Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\[ \\left(\\dfrac{2y^{-2}z^{-5}}{4x^{-3}y^6}\\right)^{-4}. \\] Solution. \\[ \\left(\\dfrac{2y^{-2}z^{-5}}{4x^{-3}y^6}\\right)^{-4} =\\left(\\dfrac{x^3}{2z^{5}y^8}\\right)^{-4} =\\left(\\dfrac{2z^{5}y^8}{x^3}\\right)^4 =\\dfrac{2^4(z^{5})^4(y^8)^4}{(x^3)^4} =\\dfrac{16y^{32}z^{20}}{x^{12}}. \\] Simplify (at least partially) the problem first To avoid mistakes when working with negative exponents, it’s better to apply the negative exponent rule to change negative exponents to positive exponents and simplify the base first. 1.3 Practice Problem 1.1 Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\((3a^2b^3c^2)(4abc^2)(2b^2c^3)\\) \\(\\dfrac{4y^3z^0}{x^2y^2}\\) \\((-2)^{-3}\\) Problem 1.2 Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\(\\dfrac{-u^0v^{15}}{v^{16}}\\) \\((-2a^3b^2c^0)^3\\) \\(\\dfrac{m^5 n^{2}}{(mn)^3}\\) Problem 1.3 Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\((-3a^2x^3)^{-2}\\) \\(\\left(\\dfrac{-x^0y^3}{2wz^2}\\right)^3\\) \\(\\dfrac{3^{-2}a^{-3}b^5}{x^{-3}y^{-4}}\\) Problem 1.4 Simplify. Write with positive exponents. \\(\\left(-x^{-1}(-y)^2\\right)^3\\) \\(\\left(\\dfrac{6x^{-2}y^5}{2y^{-3}z^{-11}}\\right)^{-3}\\) \\(\\dfrac{(3 x^{2} y^{-1})^{-3}(2 x^{-3} y^{2})^{-1}}{(x^{6} y^{-5})^{-2}}\\) Problem 1.5 A store has large size and small size watermelons. A large one cost $4 and a small one $1. Putting on the same table, a smaller watermelons has only half the height of the larger one. Given $4, will you buy a large watermelon or 4 smaller ones? Why?

Find the value of the polynomial \\(2x^3-98x\\) when \\(x=-7\\). Find the value of the polynomial \\(x^2-9x-22\\) when \\(x=11\\). Find the value of the polynomial \\(x^3-2x^2-9x+18\\) when \\(x=-3\\). Find the value of \\(16^2-14^2\\). 2.2 Factor by Removing the GCF The greatest common factor (GCF) of two terms is a polynomial with the greatest coefficient and of the highest possible degree that divides each term. To factor a polynomial is to express the polynomial as a product of polynomials of lower degrees. The first and the easiest step is to factor out the GCF of all terms. Example 2.1 Factor \\(4x^3y-8x^2y^2+12x^3y^3\\). Solution. Find the GCF of all terms. The GCF of \\(4x^3y\\), \\(-8x^2y^2\\) and \\(12x^4y^3\\) is \\(4x^2y\\). Write each term as the product of the GCF and the remaining factor. \\(4x^3y=(4x^2y)\\cdot x\\), \\(-8x^2y^2=(4x^2y)\\cdot (-2y)\\), and \\(12x^4y^3=(4x^2y)(3xy^2)\\). Factor out the GCF from each term. \\(4x^3y-8x^2y^2+12x^3y^3=4x^2y\\cdot(x-2y+3xy^2)\\). 2.3 Factor by Grouping For a four-term polynomial, in general, we will group them into two groups and factor out the GCF for each group and then factor further. Example 2.2 Factor \\(2x^2-6xy+xz-3yz\\). Solution. Group the first two terms and the last two terms. \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;2x^2-6xy+xz-3yz\\\\ =&amp;(2x^2-6xy)+(xz-3yz) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the GCF from each group. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;2x(x-3y)+z(x-3y) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the binomial GCF. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;(x-3y)(2x+z). \\end{aligned} \\] Example 2.3 Factor \\(ax+4b-2a-2bx\\). Solution. Group the first term with the third term and group the second term with the last term. \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;ax+4b-2a-2bx\\\\ =&amp;(ax-2a)+(-2bx+4b) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the GCF from each group. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;a(x-2)+(-2b)(x-2) \\end{aligned} \\] Factor out the binomial GCF. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;(x-2)(a-2b). \\end{aligned} \\] Guess and check. Once you factored one group, you may expect that the other group has the same binomial factor so that factoring may be continued. 2.4 Factor Difference of Powers Factoring is closely related to solving polynomial equations. If a polynomial equation \\(p(x)=0\\) has a solution \\(r\\), then \\(p(x)\\) has a factor \\(x-r\\). For example, \\(x^n-r^n=0\\) has a solution \\(x=r\\). So the difference \\(x^n-r^n\\) has a factor \\((x-r)\\). Using long division or by induction, we obtain the following equality. Difference of \\(n\\)-th powers \\[a^n-b^n=(a-b)(a^{n-1}+a^{n-2}b+\\cdots +ab^{n-2}+b^{n-1})\\] In particular, \\[a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b).\\] Example 2.4 Factor \\(25x^2-16\\). Solution. Recognize the binomial as a difference of squares. \\[\\begin{aligned} &amp;25x^2-16\\\\ =&amp;(5x)^2-4^2 \\end{aligned} \\] Apply the formula. \\[ \\begin{aligned} =&amp;(5x-4)(5x+4). \\end{aligned} \\] Example 2.5 Factor \\(32x^3y-2xy^5\\) completely. Solution. \\[ 32x^3y-2xy^3=2xy(16x^2-y^4)=2xy((4x)^2-(y^2)^2)=2xy(4x+y^2)(4x-y^2). \\] 2.5 Factor Trinomials If a trinomial \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), \\(A\\neq 0\\), can be factored, then it can be expressed as a product of two binomials: \\[ax^2+bx+c=(mx+n)(px+q).\\] By simplify the product using the FOIL method and comparing coefficients, we observe that \\[ a=\\underbrace{mn}_{\\mathrm{F}}\\quad\\quad\\quad b=\\underbrace{mq}_{\\mathrm{O}}~\\underset{+}{\\underset{}{+}}~\\underbrace{np}_{\\mathrm{I}} \\quad\\quad\\quad c=\\underbrace{nq}_{\\mathrm{F}} \\] A trinomial \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) is also called a quadratic polynomial. The function defined by \\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\\) is called a quadratic function. Trial and error. The observation suggests to use trial and error to find the undetermined coefficients \\(m\\), \\(n\\), \\(p\\), and \\(q\\) from factors of \\(a\\) and \\(c\\) such that the sum of cross products \\(mq+np\\) is \\(b\\). A diagram as shown in the following examples will be helpful to check a trial. Example 2.6 Factor \\(x^2+6x+8\\). Solution. Factor \\(a=1\\): \\[1=1\\cdot 1.\\] Factor \\(c=8\\): \\[8=1\\cdot 8=2\\cdot 4.\\] Choose a proper combination of pairs of factors and check if the sum of cross product equals \\(b=6\\): \\[1\\cdot 4+ 1\\cdot 2=6.\\] This step can be checked easily using the following diagram. Factor the trinomial \\[x^2+6x+8=(x+2)(x+4).\\] Example 2.7 Factor \\(2x^2+5x-3\\). Solution. Factor \\(a=2\\): \\[1=1\\cdot 2.\\] Factor \\(c=-3\\): \\[-3=1\\cdot (-3)=(-1)\\cdot 3.\\] Choose a proper combination of pairs of factors and if the sum of cross products equals \\(b=5\\): \\[2\\cdot 3+1\\cdot(-1)=5.\\] This step can be checked easily using the following diagram. Factor the trinomial \\[2x^2+5x-3=(x+3)(2x-1).\\] Use Auxiliary Problem. Some higher degree polynomials may be rewrite as a trinomial after a substitution. Factoring the trinomial helps factor the polynomial. Example 2.8 Factor the trinomial completely. \\[4x^4-x^2-3\\] Solution. Let \\(x^2=y\\). Then \\(4x^4-x^2-3=4y^2-y-3\\). Factor the trinomial in \\(y\\): \\(4y^2-y-3=(4y+3)(y-1)\\). Replace \\(y\\) by \\(x^2\\) and factor further. \\[ \\begin{split} 4x^4-x^2-3&amp;=4y^2-y-3\\\\ &amp;=(4y+3)(y-1)\\\\ &amp;=(4x^2+3)(x^2-1)\\\\ &amp;=(4x^2+3)(x-1)(x+1). \\end{split} \\] 2.6 Practice Problem 2.1 Factor out the GCF. \\(18x^2y^2-12xy^3-6x^3y^4\\) \\(5x(x-7)+3y(x-7)\\) \\(-2a^2(x+y)+3a(x+y)\\) Problem 2.2 Factor by grouping. \\(12xy-10y+18x-15\\) \\(12ac-18bc-10ad+15bd\\) \\(5ax-4bx-5ay+4by\\) Problem 2.3 Factor completely. \\(25x^2-4\\) \\(8x^3-2x\\) \\(25xy^2+x\\) Problem 2.4 Factor completely. \\(3x^3+6x^2-12x-24\\) \\(x^4+3x^3-4x^2-12x\\) Problem 2.5 Factor the trinomial. \\(x^2+4x+3\\) \\(x^2+6x-7\\) \\(x^2-3x-10\\) Problem 2.6 Factor the trinomial. \\(5x^2+7x+2\\) \\(2x^2+5x-12\\) \\(3x^2-10x-8\\) Problem 2.7 Factor completely into polynomials with integer coefficients. \\(x^3-5x^2+6x\\) \\(4x^4-12x^2+5\\) \\(2x^3y-9x^2y^2-5xy^3\\) "],

After 30 minutes, he received an emergency call and has to return in 20 minute. The speed of the current of the river is 1 mph. Under normal condition, a paddler’s average paddling speed is between 2 and 5 mph. Do you think Matt can return on time?

Equivalent Reduction. What if all denominators are the same? How to make denominators the same? Reducing the problem to an easier one using equivalent operations helps solve the problem. Example 3.8 Find the LCD of \\(\\dfrac{3}{x^2-x-6}\\) and \\(\\dfrac{6}{x^2-4}\\). Solution. Factor each denominator. \\[ x^2-x-6=(x+2)(x-3)\\qquad x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2) \\] List the factors of the first denominator and add unlisted factors of the second factor to get the final list. First list \\((x+2)\\) \\((x-3)\\) Second list \\((x+2)\\) \\((x-2)\\) Final list \\((x+2)\\) \\((x-3)\\) \\((x-2)\\) The LCD is the product of factors in the final list. \\[(x+2)(x-3)(x-2).\\] Example 3.9 Subtract and simplify \\[\\dfrac{x-3}{x^2-2x-8}- \\dfrac{1}{x^2-4}\\] Solution. Find the LCD. First factor denominators. \\[x^2-2x-8=(x+2)(x-4)\\] \\[x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2)\\] Then using the table to find the final list of factors of the LCD. First list \\((x+2)\\) \\((x-4)\\) Second list \\((x+2)\\) \\((x-2)\\) Final list \\((x+2)\\) \\((x-2)\\) \\((x-4)\\) The LCD is \\((x+2)(x-2)(x-4)\\). Rewrite each rational expression into an equivalent expression with the LCD as the new denominator. \\[ \\dfrac{x-3}{x^2-2x-8}- \\dfrac{1}{x^2-4}=\\dfrac{(x-3)(x-2)}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-4)}-\\dfrac{(x-4)}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-4)} \\] Subtract and simplify. \\[ \\dfrac{(x-3)(x-2)-(x-4)}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-4)}=\\dfrac{(x^2-5x+6)-(x-4)}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-4)}=\\dfrac{x^2-6x+10}{(x+2)(x-2)(x-4)} \\] 3.7 Simplifying Complex Rational Expressions A complex rational expression is a rational expression whose denominator or numerator contains a rational expression. A complex rational expression is equivalent to the quotient of its numerator by its denominator. That suggests the following strategy to simplify a complex rational expression. Simplify and Change the Viewpoint. A complex rational expression is a quotient of two rational expressions. You may rewrite it as an multiplication by flipping the denominator. However, it’s better to simply the numerator and denominator or you won’t see a good looking new expression. Example 3.10 Simplify \\[ \\dfrac{~\\dfrac{2x-1}{x^2-1}+\\dfrac{x-1}{x+1}~}{~\\dfrac{x+1}{x-1}-\\dfrac{1}{x^2-1}~} \\] Solution. Simplify the numerator and the denominator. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{~\\dfrac{2x-1}{x^2-1}+\\dfrac{x-1}{x+1}~}{~\\dfrac{x+1}{x-1}-\\dfrac{1}{x^2-1}~} =&amp;\\dfrac{ ~\\dfrac{2x-1}{(x-1)(x+1)}+\\dfrac{(x-1)(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }{~ \\dfrac{(x+1)(x+1)}{(x-1)(x+1)}-\\dfrac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }\\\\[5pt] =&amp;\\dfrac{ ~\\dfrac{(2x-1)+(x-1)(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }{ ~\\dfrac{(x+1)(x+1)-1}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }\\\\[5pt] =&amp;\\dfrac{ ~\\dfrac{(2x-1)+(x^2-2x+1)}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }{ ~\\dfrac{(x^2+2x+1)-1}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }\\\\[5pt] =&amp;\\dfrac{ ~\\dfrac{x^2}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }{ ~\\dfrac{x^2+2x}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ } \\end{aligned} \\] Rewrite as a product. \\[ \\dfrac{ ~\\dfrac{x^2}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ }{ ~\\dfrac{x^2+2x}{(x-1)(x+1)}~ } =\\dfrac{x^2}{(x-1)(x+1)}\\cdot \\dfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x^2+2x} \\] Multiply and simplify. \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\dfrac{x^2}{(x-1)(x+1)}\\cdot \\dfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x^2+2x} =&amp;\\dfrac{x\\cdot x}{(x-1)(x+1)}\\cdot \\dfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x(x+2)}\\\\[5pt] =&amp; \\dfrac{\\bcancel{x}x\\cancel{(x-1)(x+1)}}{\\bcancel{x}(x+2)\\cancel{(x-1)(x+1)}}\\\\[5pt] =&amp; \\dfrac{x}{x+2} \\end{aligned} \\] Another way to simplify a complex rational expression is to multiply the LCD to both the denominator and numerator and then simplify.

How long should the ladder be placed to reach the window? The hight of that window is 50 feet. Picture from www.montgomerycountymd.gov demonstrating the positioning of a turntable aerial ladder truck 4.2 Radical Expressions If \\(b^2=a\\), then we say that \\(b\\) is a square root of \\(a\\). We denote the positive square root of \\(a\\) as \\(\\sqrt{a}\\), called the principal square root. For any real number \\(a\\), the expression \\(\\sqrt{a^2}\\) can be simplified as \\[ \\sqrt{a^2}=|a|. \\] If \\(b^3=a\\), then we say that \\(b\\) is a cube root of \\(a\\). The cube root of a real number \\(a\\) is denoted by \\(\\sqrt[3]{a}\\). For any real number \\(a\\), the expression \\(\\sqrt[3]{a^3}\\) can be simplified as \\[ \\sqrt[3]{a^3}=a. \\] In general, if \\(b^n=a\\), then we say that \\(b\\) is an \\(n\\)-th root of \\(a\\). If \\(n\\) is even, the positive \\(n\\)-th root of \\(a\\), called the principal \\(n\\)-th root, is denoted by \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\). If \\(n\\) is odd, the \\(n\\)-the root \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) of \\(a\\) has the same sign with \\(a\\). In \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\), the symbol \\(\\sqrt{\\phantom{a}}\\) is called the radical sign, \\(a\\) is called the radicand, and \\(n\\) is called the index. If \\(n\\) is even, then the \\(n\\)-th root of a negative number is not a real number. For any real number \\(a\\), the expression \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^n}\\) can be simplified as \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^n}=|a|\\) if \\(n\\) is even. \\(\\sqrt[n]{a^n}=a\\) if \\(n\\) is odd. A radical is simplified if the radicand has no perfect power factors against the radical. Example 4.1 Simplify the radical expression using the definition. \\(\\sqrt{4(y-1)^2}\\) \\(\\sqrt[3]{-8x^3y^6}\\) Solution. \\(\\sqrt{4(y-1)^2}=\\sqrt{[2(y-1)]^2}=2|y-1|\\). \\(\\sqrt[3]{-8x^3y^6}=\\sqrt[3]{(-2xy^2)^2}=-2xy^2\\). 4.3 Rational Exponents If \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) is a real number, then we define \\(a^{\\frac mn}\\) as \\[ a^{\\frac mn}=\\sqrt[n]{a^m}=(\\sqrt[n]{a})^m. \\] Rational exponents have the same properties as integral exponents: \\(a^m\\cdot a^n=a^{m+n}\\) \\(\\dfrac{a^m}{a^n}=a^{m-n}\\) \\(a^{-\\frac mn}=\\dfrac{~1~}{~a^{\\frac mn}~}\\) \\((a^m)^n=a^{mn}\\) \\((ab)^m=a^m\\cdot b^m\\) \\(\\left(\\dfrac ab\\right)^m=\\dfrac{a^m}{b^m}\\) Example 4.2 Simplify the radical expression or the expression with rational exponents. Write in radical notation. \\(\\sqrt{x}\\sqrt[3]{x^2}\\) \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{x^3}}\\) \\(\\left(\\frac{x^{\\frac12}}{x^{-\\frac56}}\\right )^{\\frac14}\\) \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{x^{-\\frac12}y^2}{x^{\\frac32}}}\\) Solution. \\[ \\sqrt{x}\\sqrt[3]{x^2}=x^{\\frac12}x^{\\frac{2}{3}}=x^{\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{2}{3}}=x^\\frac{7}{6}=x\\sqrt[6]{x}. \\] \\[ \\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt{x^3}}=(\\sqrt{x^3})^\\frac{1}{3}=[(x^3)^{\\frac{1}{2}}]^{\\frac{1}{3}}=x^{3\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}}=x^{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\sqrt{x}. \\] \\[ \\left(\\frac{x^{\\frac12}}{x^{-\\frac56}}\\right)^{\\frac14}=(x^{\\frac12}x^{\\frac56})^{\\frac14}=(x^{\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{5}{6}})^{\\frac{1}{4}}=(x^\\frac{4}{3})^{\\frac{1}{4}}=x^{\\frac{1}{3}}=\\sqrt[3]{x}. \\] \\[ \\sqrt{\\frac{x^{-\\frac12}y^2}{x^{\\frac32}}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{y^2}{x^2}}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac yx\\right)^2}=\\left|\\frac yx\\right|. \\] In general, rewriting radical in rational exponents helps simplify calculations. 4.4 Product and Quotient Rules for Radicals If \\(\\sqrt[n]{a}\\) and \\(\\sqrt[n]{b}\\) are real numbers, then \\[{\\sqrt[n]a}{\\sqrt[n]b}=\\sqrt[n]{ab}.\\] If \\(\\sqrt[n]a\\) and \\(\\sqrt[n]b\\) are real numbers and \\(b\\neq 0\\), then \\[\\dfrac{\\sqrt[n]a}{\\sqrt[n]b}=\\sqrt[n]{\\dfrac ab}.\\] Example 4.3 Simplify the expression. \\(\\sqrt[4]{8xy^4}\\sqrt[4]{2x^7y}\\). \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt[5]{96x^9y^3}}{\\sqrt[5]{3x^{-1}y}}\\). Solution. \\(\\sqrt[4]{8xy^4}\\sqrt[4]{2x^7y}=\\sqrt[4]{(8xy^4)\\cdot (2x^7y)}=\\sqrt[4]{16x^8y^5}=\\sqrt[4]{2^4(x^2)^4y^4\\cdot y}=2x^2y\\sqrt[4]{y}\\). \\(\\dfrac{ \\sqrt[5]{96x^9y^3} }{ \\sqrt[5]{3x^{-1}y} }=\\sqrt[5]{\\dfrac{96x^9y^3}{3x^{-1}y}}=\\sqrt[5]{32x^{10}y^2}=\\sqrt[5]{(2x^2)^5\\cdot y^2}=2x^2\\sqrt[5]{y^2}\\). 4.5 Combining Like Radicals Two radicals are called like radicals if they have the same index and the same radicand. We add or subtract like radicals by combining their coefficients. Example 4.4 Simplify the expression. \\[ \\sqrt{8x^3}-\\sqrt{(-2)^2 x^4}+\\sqrt{2x^5}. \\] Solution. \\[ \\sqrt{8x^3}-\\sqrt{(-2)^2 x^4}+\\sqrt{2x^5}=2x\\sqrt{2x}-2x^2+x^2\\sqrt{2x}=(x^2+2x)\\sqrt{2x}-2x^2. \\] 4.6 Multiplying Radicals Multiplying radical expressions with many terms is similar to that multiplying polynomials with many terms. Example 4.5 Simplify the expression. \\[ (\\sqrt{2x}+2\\sqrt{x})(\\sqrt{2x}-3\\sqrt{x}). \\] Solution. \\[ \\begin{aligned} (\\sqrt{2x}+2\\sqrt{x})(\\sqrt{2x}-3\\sqrt{x}) =&amp;\\sqrt{2x}\\cdot\\sqrt{2x}-3\\sqrt{x}\\cdot\\sqrt{2x}+2\\sqrt{x}\\cdot\\sqrt{2x}-6\\sqrt{x}\\cdot\\sqrt{x}\\\\ =&amp;2x-3x\\sqrt{2}+2x\\sqrt{2}-6x\\\\ =&amp;-4x-x\\sqrt{2}\\\\ =&amp;-(4+\\sqrt{2})x. \\end{aligned} \\] 4.7 Rationalizing Denominators Rationalizing denominator means rewriting a radical expression into an equivalent expression in which the denominator no longer contains radicals. Example 4.6 Rationalize the denominator. \\(\\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^3}}\\) \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{y}}\\) Solution. In this case, to get rid of the radical in the bottom, we multiply the expression by \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}}\\) so that the radicand in the bottom becomes a perfect power. \\[ \\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^3}}=\\dfrac{1}{2\\sqrt{x^3}}\\cdot\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{\\sqrt{x}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{2\\sqrt{x^2}\\sqrt{x}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}}{2x^2}. \\] In this case, we use the formula \\((a-b)(a+b)=a^2+b^2\\). Multiply the expression by \\(\\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}\\). \\[ \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{y}}=\\dfrac{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2}{(\\sqrt{x}-\\sqrt{y})(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})}=\\dfrac{x+y+2\\sqrt{xy}}{x-y}. \\] 4.8 Practice Problem 4.1 Evaluate the square root.

The grading policy of the course says that homework counts 20%, monthly test counts 45% and the final exam counts for 35%. At the last day of class a student wants to know the minimum grade needed on the final to get a grade C or better, equivalently, overall grade 74 or above. The student earned 100 on homework and 80 on monthly test. What the minimum grade the student must earn on the final to get a C or better? If, in addition, the final exam must be at least 55 to earn a C or better, what would be the minimum grade needed? The college student has attempted 30 credits and a cumulated GPA 1.8. To graduate from the college, the GPA must be 2.0 or higher and the total credits must be at least 60. Now the student decides to spend more time on studying and aims at an cumulated GPA 2.5 on further courses. How many more attempted credits the student must earn to graduate? Cumulated GPA = \\(\\dfrac{\\text{Total Quality Points Earned}}{\\text{Total Attempted Credits}}\\) Total Quality Points Earned = Sum of \\(\\text{Credits Attempted}\\times \\text{Grade Value}\\) 8.2 Properties and Definitions Properties of Inequalities An inequality defines a relationship between two expressions. The following properties show when the inequality relationship is preserved or reversed. Property Example The additive property If \\(a&lt;b\\), then \\(a+c&lt;b+c\\), for any real number \\(c\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\), then \\(a-c&lt;b-c\\), for any real number \\(c\\). If \\(x+3&lt;5\\), then \\(x+3-3&lt;5-3\\). Simplifying both sides, we get \\(x&lt;2\\). The positive multiplication property If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is positive, then \\(ac&lt;bc\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is positive, then \\(\\frac ac&lt;\\frac bc\\). If \\(2x&lt;4\\), then \\(\\frac{2x}{2}&lt;\\frac{4}{2}\\). Simplifying both sides, we get \\(x&lt;2\\). The negative multiplication property If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is negative, then \\(ac&gt;bc\\). If \\(a&lt;b\\) and \\(c\\) is negative, then \\(\\frac ac&gt;\\frac bc\\). If \\(1&lt;2\\), then \\(-2=1\\cdot(-2)&gt;2\\cdot(-2)=-4\\). If \\(-2x&lt;4\\), then \\(\\frac{-2x}{-2}&gt;\\frac{4}{-2}\\). Simplifying both sides, we get \\(x&gt;2\\). These properties also apply to \\(a\\leq b\\), \\(a&gt;b\\) and \\(a\\geq b\\). It’s always better to view \\(a-c\\) as \\(a+(-c)\\). Because addition has the commutative property. Compound Inequalities A compound inequality is formed by two inequalities with the word and or the word or. For examples, the following are three commonly seen type compound inequalities: \\[ x-1&gt;2\\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2x+1&lt;3, \\] \\[ 3x-5&lt;4\\quad \\text{or} \\quad 3x-2&gt;10, \\] \\[ -3\\leq \\frac{2x-4}{3}&lt;2. \\] The third compound inequality is simplified expression for the compound inequality \\(-3\\leq \\frac{2x-4}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{2x-4}{3}&lt;2\\). Interval Notations Solutions to an inequality normally form an interval which has boundaries and should reflect inequality signs. Depending on the form of an inequality, we may a single interval and a union of intervals. For example, suppose \\(a&lt;b\\), we have the following equivalent representations of inequalities. \\(x&lt;a\\) \\(x\\ge b\\) \\(a\\le x&lt;b\\) \\(x\\le a\\) or \\(x&gt;b\\) \\((-\\infty, a)\\) \\([b,\\infty)\\) \\([a, b)\\) \\((-\\infty, a]\\cup (b,\\infty)\\) 8.3 Examples Think backward. To solve a problem, knowing what to expect helps you narrow down the gap step by step by comparing the goal and your achievement. An inequality (equation) is solved if the unknown variable is isolated. That’s what to be expected. To isolate the unknown variable, you use comparisons to determine what mathematical operations should be applied. When an operation is applied to one side, the same operation should also be applied to the other side. For inequalities, we also need to determine whether the inequality sign should be preserved or reversed according to the operation. Example 8.1 Solve the linear inequality \\[ 2x+4&gt;0. \\] Solution. \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp; &amp; 2x+4 &amp; &gt;0 \\\\ \\text{add $-4$} &amp; &amp; 2x &amp; &gt;-4 \\\\ \\text{divide by $2$} &amp; &amp; x &amp; &gt;-2 \\end{aligned} \\] The solution set is \\((-2, \\infty)\\). Example 8.2 Solve the linear inequality \\[ -3x-4&lt;2. \\] Solution. \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp; &amp; -3x-4 &amp; &lt;2 \\\\ \\text{add $4$} &amp; &amp; -3x &amp; &lt;6 &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{divide by $-3$ and switch} &amp; &amp; x &amp; &gt;-2 \\end{aligned} \\] The solution set is \\((-2, +\\infty)\\). Example 8.3 Solve the compound linear inequality \\[ x+2&lt;3\\quad \\text{and}\\quad -2x-3&lt;1. \\] Solution. \\[ \\begin{aligned} x+2 &amp; &lt;3 &amp; &amp; \\text{and} &amp; -2x-3 &amp; &lt;1 \\\\ x &amp; &lt;1 &amp; &amp; &amp; -2x &amp; &lt;4 \\\\ x &amp; &lt;1 &amp; &amp; \\text{and} &amp; x &amp; &gt;-2 \\end{aligned} \\] That is \\(-2&lt;x&lt;1\\). The solution set is \\((-2, 1)\\). Example 8.4 Solve the compound linear inequality \\[ -x+4&gt;2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 2x-5\\geq -3. \\] Solution. \\[ \\begin{aligned} -x+4 &amp; &gt;2 &amp; &amp; \\text{or} &amp; 2x-5 &amp; \\geq -3 \\\\ -x &amp; &gt;-2 &amp; &amp; &amp; 2x &amp; \\geq 2 \\\\ x &amp; &lt;2 &amp; &amp; \\text{or} &amp; x &amp; \\geq 1 \\end{aligned} \\] That is \\(x\\geq 1\\) or \\(x&lt; 2\\). The solution set is \\((-\\infty, +\\infty)\\). Example 8.5 Solve the compound linear inequality \\[ -4\\leq\\dfrac{2x-4}{3}&lt;2. \\] Solution. \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} -4\\leq &amp; \\dfrac{2x-4}{3} &amp; &lt;2 \\\\ -12\\leq &amp; 2x-4 &amp; &lt;6 \\\\ -8\\leq &amp; 2x &amp; &lt;10 \\\\ -4\\leq &amp; x &amp; &lt;5 \\end{array} \\] The solution set is \\([-4, 5)\\). Example 8.6 Solve the compound linear inequality \\[ -1\\leq \\dfrac{-3x+4}{2}&lt;3. \\] Solution. \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} -1\\leq &amp; \\frac{-3x+4}{2} &amp; &lt;3 \\\\ -2\\leq &amp; -3x+4 &amp; &lt;6 \\\\ -6\\leq &amp; -3x &amp; &lt;2 \\\\ 2\\geq &amp; x &amp; &gt;-\\frac23 \\end{array} \\] The solution set is \\((-\\frac23, 2]\\). Example 8.7 Suppose that \\(-1\\le x &lt; 2\\). Find the range of \\(5-3x\\). Write your answer in interval notation. Solution.
