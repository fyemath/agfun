# Introduction {-}

This notebook is intended to give a brief introduction to elementary functions emphasizing on effective thinking in algebra and geometry.

In the first part, we will review mathematical operations including addition, multiplication, $n$-th root, exponentiation and logarithm.

In the second part, we will study the concepts of functions, algebraic functions and their applications.

In the third part, we will study elementary transcendental functions and applications.

Comments and suggestions are very welcome.
