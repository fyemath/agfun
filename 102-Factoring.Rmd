# Review of Factoring

## Factor by Removing the GCF

***The  greatest common factor (GCF)*** of two terms is a polynomial with the **greatest coefficient** and of the **highest possible degree** that divides each term.

To ***factor a polynomial*** is to **express the polynomial as a product** of polynomials of lower degrees. The first and the easiest step is to factor out the GCF of all terms.

```{example}

Factor $4x^3y-8x^2y^2+12x^3y^3$.

```

```{solution}

1. Find the GCF of all terms.  
    The GCF of $4x^3y$, $-8x^2y^2$ and $12x^4y^3$ is $4x^2y$.

1. Write each term as the product of the GCF and the remaining factor.  
    $4x^3y=(4x^2y)\cdot x$, $-8x^2y^2=(4x^2y)\cdot (-2y)$, and $12x^4y^3=(4x^2y)(3xy^2)$.

1. Factor out the GCF from each term.  
    $4x^3y-8x^2y^2+12x^3y^3=4x^2y\cdot(x-2y+3xy^2)$.

```

## Factor by Grouping

For a four-term polynomial, in general, we will group them into two groups and factor out the GCF for each group and then factor further.

```{example}

Factor $2x^2-6xy+xz-3yz$.

```

```{solution}

1. Group the first two terms and the last two terms.
$$
\begin{aligned}
&2x^2-6xy+xz-3yz\\
=&(2x^2-6xy)+(xz-3yz)
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Factor out the GCF from each group.
$$
\begin{aligned}
% &(2x^2-6xy)+(xz-3yz)\\
=&2x(x-3y)+z(x-3y)
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Factor out the binomial GCF.
$$
\begin{aligned}
% &2x(x-3y)+z(x-3y)\\
=&(x-3y)(2x+z).
\end{aligned}
$$

```

```{example}

Factor $ax+4b-2a-2bx$.

```

```{solution}

1. Group the first term with the third term and group the second term with the last term.
$$
\begin{aligned}
&ax+4b-2a-2bx\\
=&(ax-2a)+(-2bx+4b)
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Factor out the GCF from each group.
$$
\begin{aligned}
% &(ax-2a)+(-2bx+4b)\\
=&a(x-2)+(-2b)(x-2)
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Factor out the binomial GCF.
$$
\begin{aligned}
% &a(x-2)+(-2b)(x-2)\\
=&(x-2)(a-2b).
\end{aligned}
$$

```

```{block2, type="rmdtip"}

**Guess and check.** Once you factored one group, you may expect that the other group has the same binomial factor so that factoring may be continued.

```

## Factor Difference of Squares

Difference of squares

$$a^2-b^2=(a-b)(a+b)$$

```{example}

Factor $25x^2-16$.

```

```{solution}

1. Recognize the binomial as a difference of squares.
$$\begin{aligned}
&25x^2-16\\
=&(5x)^2-4^2
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Apply the formula.
$$
\begin{aligned}
% &25x^2-16\\=&(5x)^2-4^2\\
=&(5x-4)(5x+4).
\end{aligned}
$$

```


```{example}
Factor $32x^3y-2xy^5$ completely.
```

```{solution}
$$
32x^3y-2xy^3=2xy(16x^2-y^4)=2xy((4x)^2-(y^2)^2)=2xy(4x+y^2)(4x-y^2).
$$
```
